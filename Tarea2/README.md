# 2nd Project - File Server V2

## Synopsis

This project is an upgrade, or newer version, of the previews File Server. It has the same functionalities but the download and upload process of files it's now using file transferring by chunks. With this method the server can now attend multiple client requests at the same time and the clients no longer have to wait for the server to finish with one client to get attention from it.

The checksum function also changed, previously was used an MD5 and now it’s using SHA1.

The installation, dependencies and execution remains the same as the previous version. This version is now located on “Tarea2” directory.
